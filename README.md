# Greys-Grains-and-Brewing-Patch
A patch for the RimWorld mod Grains and Brewing (1.4+)

Mostly just small tweaks to Tidal's Grains and Brewing mod, which has been continued by Holgast.

The issue with GAB is that most of the crops are absolutely terrible and there are few reasons to grow them. This mod is just an xml patch that changes the various parameters to reflect both RimWorld strategic considerations and real world phenomenon.

Still in the process of tweaking before releasing on workshop. First experimental patch will be reducing sorghum growing time by 25% and increasing yield by 25%. As it currently stands, this crop is significantly worse than even the worst crops in vanilla, even with the fertility resilience in poor soil.
